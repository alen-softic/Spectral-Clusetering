# Multiclass Spectral Clusetering and k-means
Alen Softic

## About this project
There are three topics in this project.
1. We attempt to classify the hadwritten digits, links to which can be found in [here](https://users.mai.liu.se/larel04/matrix-methods/index.html), under the 'Computer assignments'. In the spirit of unsupervised learning, methods used are iterative k-means, relaxed k-means and spectral clustering usin Gaussian kernels. While perhaps not suitable, using spectral clustering here serves only as a comparison metheod. 
2. Using the above methods to classify 1D and 2D data, showing how spectral clusstering may be used to classify highly nonlinear data where most classification methods like LDA and QDA would fail. An app called 'Multiclass Spectral Clusetering' provides a GUI for this purpose. Gaussian kernel is used here as well.
2.1 **Installing the app** To instal the app simply go to the 'Apps' window in MATLAB, click 'Install App' and select 'Multiclass Spectral Clusetering.mlappinstall'.
3. Image segmentation of our university logo using spectral clustering.
